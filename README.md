_[TOC]_

This repository contains the components of the Keycloak App for the UCS Appcenter.

# App base

The app uses [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/17.0/) to provide a SAML and OpenID Connect provider.

The docker image used in the app is [keycloak](https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak?tab=tags), provided by RedHat.

# Realm Configuration

* Keycloak comes with a Realm `master` by default.
* Additionally the UCS Keycloak App creates a realm `UCS`.

# LDAP User Federation

* This Keycloak App is configured to use "User Federation" in the Keycloak Realm named "UCS".
* The "User Federation" configured in the `UCS` uses `uid=sys-idp-user,cn=users,$ldap_base` to bind to OpenLDAP.
* The "User Federation" is configured to **not** sync user accounts from LDAP to Keycloak.

# SAML Support

* Keycloak automatically acts as SAML IdP. For each SP (SAML or OIDC) a "Client" configuration needs to be created
  in Keycloak.
    * In its initial version, the Keycloak App creates a "Client" for the UMC on the FQDN of the host
      which it is installed on.
* Keycloak can be configured to federate out to other IdPs. If several authentication sources are possible,
  e.g. a "User federation" and two external IdPs then Keycloak will show a login page to the user, where the user
  needs to select the method. There are ways to preselect (either hardcode in Keycloak config or pass `&kc_idp_hint=foo`
  with the login URL). Keycloak will not iterate over possible authentication sources. Names may need to get
  mapped to ensure uniqueness. See Keycloak docs for details.

# OIDC Support

TODO: Anything special to explain here?

# Configuration

The app can be configured with app settings.

To integrate other services, they often require URIs for the identity provider endpoints, they are available at `https://ucs-sso-ng.$(hostname -d)/.well-known/openid-configuration`

TODO: Update the following statement, probably outdated with the change from `keycloak.$(hostname -f)` to `ucs-sso-ng.$(hostname -d)`:

The apache2 reverse proxy config is at `/var/lib/univention-appcenter/apps/keycloak/config/vhost.conf` and there are some UCR variables `apache2/vhosts/.*` set autoamtically during join via the joinscript `/usr/lib/univention-install/50keycloak.inst` installed on the host (uploaded to the [provider-portal](https://provider-portal.software-univention.de) as [app/inst](app/inst) ).

# Internals

See [app/](app/) for app center integration files and
https://docs.software-univention.de/app-center/5.0/en/configurations.html#installation-scripts


## Special use case: Ad-Hoc-Federation using the "univention-authenticator" Keycloak SPI
* The "univention-authenticator" Keycloak SPI is an extension written in Java.
* It is shipped as part of the UCS Keycloak App, but not configured by default.
* If configured properly (TODO: details pending) it allows creating a "shadow user account" in UDM after
  successful authentication against an external IdP (see page 13 of the [Summit presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/Univention/modularisierung-und-containerisierung-von-ucs).
