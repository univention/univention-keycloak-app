Migration guide: SimpleSAMLphp/Kopano Konnect to Keycloak
#########################################################

This documentation is for system administrators who already operate |UCS| 5.0
and explains the required steps for the migration from the single sign-on
identity provider apps :program:`SimpleSAMLphp` (SAML) and
:program:`Kopano Konnect` (OIDC) to the app :program:`Keycloak`.

*******************
Notes about UCS 5.2
*******************

Starting with |UCS| 5.2 the :program:`Keycloak` app replaces
:program:`SimpleSAMLphp` and the :program:`Kopano Konnect` app as the default
identity providers in |UCS|. The reason for this change is that
:program:`Keycloak` has many advantages in terms of features, configurability,
and maintainability over the alternatives, for example Keycloak provides OIDC
and SAML endpoints in one component.


.. warning::

   Migration from :program:`SimpleSAMLphp` to :program:`Keycloak` is mandatory
   before upgrading from |UCS| 5.0 to |UCS| 5.2. :program:`SimpleSAMLphp` and
   :program:`Kopano Konnect` are deprecated and will be removed in |UCS| 5.2.

If you use single sign-on for authentication in your |UCS| domain, read this
document, migrate all services to use :program:`Keycloak` as |IDP| and complete
the migration with the steps in :ref:`update-to-ucs-5.2`.

If you are absolutely sure that single sign-on for authentication is not used
in your |UCS| domain, you can skip the migration part and just prepare your
domain for the update to |UCS| 5.2, following the steps in
:ref:`update-to-ucs-5.2`.
