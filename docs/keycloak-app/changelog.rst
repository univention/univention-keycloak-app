24.0.3-ucs1
===========

Released: 6. May 2024

* The app updates to :program:`Keycloak` version 24.0.3
  (https://www.keycloak.org/docs/24.0.0/release_notes/).

* From this version on :program:`Keycloak` automatically redirects from the
  welcome page to the login page of the *Keycloak Admin Console*.
  The internal docker health check script has been changed to no longer expect
  the welcome page, but instead ask the :program:`Keycloak` health endpoints
  (enabled by the option ``--health-enabled=true``) for the status.

23.0.7-ucs1
===========

Released: 6. April 2024

* The app updates to :program:`Keycloak`  version 23.0.7 of the upstream Docker
  image from https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak.

* The ad hoc federation feature has been removed from the App due to incompatibility
  with the new :program:`Keycloak` version. If you used this feature in production,
  do not upgrade and contact the support of Univention.


22.0.3-ucs2
===========

Released: 20. December 2023

* Using an Oracle DB backend for :program:`Keycloak` is no longer possible. The Oracle DB
  drivers that were provided by :program:`Keycloak` have been removed. If you are currently
  using an Oracle DB as a backend for :program:`Keycloak`, a migration according to
  ref:`app-database-custom` is necessary to continue using this app.

* The container of the :program:`Keycloak` app has been changed from the upstream `Redhat`
  `ubi-micro-build` to the ucs-base-image, which is based on Debian.

* The :program:`Keycloak` app added support for PostgreSQL 15 databases.

* The error messages shown during login using :program:`Keycloak` have been
  adapted to show more detailed information in case an account is locked, expired or disabled.


22.0.3-ucs1
===========

Released: 27. September 2023

* The app setting :envvar:`keycloak/theme` has been removed. The UCS theme, controlled
  by the UCR variable :envvar:`ucs/web/theme` is now used.

* The :program:`Keycloak` app supports configurable links below the login dialog
  on the login page.

* When opening the login page provided by :program:`Keycloak` for the first
  time, the page shows a cookie banner, if the administrator has configured it.
  Users must accept the cookie banner, otherwise they can't continue to use
  :program:`Keycloak`.

* The app updates to *Keycloak* version 22.0.3 of the upstream Docker image from
  https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak.

22.0.1-ucs1

  using group memberships. For more information about the
  configuration of this feature, see :ref:`application-authorization`.

* If the *Keycloak* hostname is accessed using http, you are now
  directly redirected to https

* Due to longer replication times during password updates, it could happen
  that after a successful password update during the *Keycloak* login an
  error was shown. This has been fixed.

===========

Released: 31. May 2023

* The UCR variable :envvar:`keycloak/apache/config` replaces the variable
  :envvar:`ucs/server/sso/virtualhost`. In case you set

  server configuration for :program:`Keycloak`, set
  :envvar:`keycloak/apache/config` to ``true`` before the update.

  information about the configuration, see :ref:`use-case-reconfigure-sso`.
